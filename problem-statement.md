# Problem Statement

1. **Objective:**
   - The objective is to develop a responsive navbar and a complementary landing page for an e-commerce website.

2. **Navbar Features:**
   - Toggle Button: Create a button that appears on the right side of the phone screen in mobile view. It should facilitate navigation when clicked.
   - Search Bar SVG Icon: Implement an SVG icon for the search bar. Clicking the icon should open the search bar towards the left.
   - Profile Picture: Include a profile picture indicator to show whether the user is logged in or not.

3. **Landing Page:**
   - Design a sample landing page that complements the navbar.
   - Ensure responsiveness and optimization for both mobile and desktop devices.
   - Incorporate a red color theme or a similar aesthetic to align with brand identity.

4. **Development Approach:**
   - Develop the navbar and landing page from scratch using HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript.
   - Avoid relying on external dependencies such as Bootstrap or CDNs.
